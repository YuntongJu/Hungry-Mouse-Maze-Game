## How to Run Hungry Mouse on Your Computer
### Step 1: Download:
Download Hungry Mouse, including all the sub-directories. Unzip all the files, if the downloaded file is zipped.

## Step 2: Run and modify your project:
1. Go to the folder where you downloaded Hungry Mouse. You should see the file `index.html` in your folder. Double-click and open it. In most cases, you can only see a blank page with title Tiny Graphics. 

2. Open the file `host` - `host.bat` if you're Windows, `host.command` if you're Mac. On Windows, you can just double click the file open.
- Python is required for the fake server.
- On Mac, you might get a security warning instead if you double-click. Instead, right click the files, then choose Open, or you can go into System Preferences/Security & Privacy/General and click 'Open Anyway'. You may possibly need to check the file permissions and set them to 744.
- You can also consider open a terminal at this folder and run `python server.py`

3. Look in the resulting console window. If you can't find a message starting with
on `Serving HTTP on...`

4. Now you're hosting. Keep that window open.

5. Open a new window of Google Chrome. Navigate Chrome to the url http://localhost:8000/ It should show the starting page of Hungry Mouse.
